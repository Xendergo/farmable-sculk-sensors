# Farmable Sculk Sensors

In the latest 1.17 version, sculk sensors are creative only, which is kind of a shame since they're such cool blocks, so this mod lets you collect and farm them in survival

## Getting your first sensor
Sculk sensors generate sporadically underground, you'd probably find a few just by caving & and exploring mineshafts.

## Getting more
Feeding a sculk sensor to a sheep infects the sheep with sculk fungus, which means the sheep will explode in 5 seconds into 1 to 3 sculk sensors.
